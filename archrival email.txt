Dear Archrival,

Luck? 
That's an easy two! 

A while back I worked as a sales associate at Target. I really enjoy people so it was fun, though I have always had a passion for music. Playing it, writing it and figuring out how to record it in my bedroom. There were no online tutorials or free recording software at the time , so recorded myself on a cassette tape, playing along with cassette (am I dating myself? Prob). I eventually moved to Las Vegas and continuing my career at Target. One day I decided to walk into a random recording studio and see if they needed any help, coffee runs, sweeping, etc. I sat down with the owner and he asked about my interest and what I've worked on, out of nowhere he threw a Pro Tools manual at me and said come back in a week and we'll get you started. Whaaa...OK! I didn't have a computer so I just read the manual cover-to-cover and went back the following week. Fast-forward one month...I am 2nd Audio Engineer with credits including Comedy Central, Jimmy Kimmel, Sarah Silverman, MGM Grand and Too Short to name a few. Six months later I received a Platinum record for recording Ludacris and was working with Floyd Mayweather on his music production endeavors (He's gonna win the fight next week, he crazy yo!). Pretty lucky.

My second, and best, finding a random article about code on my 10 min break from cutting steel at a forge plant. For this, you can simply read my recent blog post ;)
