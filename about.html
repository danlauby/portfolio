        <h2>About Me:</h2>

        <p><strong>I have worn many hats</strong> in my professional career. Years of experience in the sales field have given me the opportunity to learn from many companies and learn about an array of products. This great because I enjoy people but a deeper passion of mine is within technology and music. I worked as a audio engineer in Las Vegas for a few years and though I am not currently persuing the profession I continue to practice my skills as a hobby.</p>

        <p>After the life of a salesperson and audio engineer I somehow found myself working as a machinist in a steel forge plant. We made parts for the Coast Guard, trains, planes and trucks. It was an interesting experience but I found myself falling further from my true interests.</p>

        <p>On a lunch break at the forge plant I happened upon a article about the interesting things web developers were creating. It sparked my interest! The next day I read a few blogs and discovered there are free online classes available. After spending several months going down the rabbit hole programming I found myself only craving more. Next step, meetups! The very first meetup I attended I shared a table with two students from Epicodus. They had wonderful things to say about the program and gave me the link to the free material the school offered. Several months later and a better understanding of coding I took the next obvious step, attend Epicodus as a student.</p>
